// This component is not strictly necessary for the requested "subtle animations on page load"
// if sections are made client components and apply animation directly.
// However, to make it more robust for animations triggered on scroll, an IntersectionObserver approach would be better.
// For this iteration, sections will apply animations directly or via a simple state in client components.
// Keeping this file empty as an alternative approach with direct CSS class application in section components will be used.
